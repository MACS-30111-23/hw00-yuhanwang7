What I have learned from the Github flow is that it is really convnient to save all the changes and can track the past work. It avoid so many steps of download and upload, which can finishing everything in terminal. Also, the markdown file avoids a lot of clickings to change the style of words. It is user friendly that does not interrupt the thinking process when one is typing.
